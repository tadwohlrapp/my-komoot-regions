# My Komoot Regions

**_My Komoot Regions_** is a userscript designed to enhance your Komoot experience by **visualizing your unlocked regions** and **providing information about your remaining free unlocks**.

This script offers two key features:

**1. Visualize your conquered regions:**

* _My Komoot Regions_ fetches your regions' GeoJSON data in the background and **displays the regions you've already unlocked** on a new layer on Komoot's map. This allows you to **easily visualize your progress** and **plan your future region unlocks**.

**2. Know your free unlock status:**

* Additionally _My Komoot Regions_ shows you the exact number of **regions you can still unlock for free**.
